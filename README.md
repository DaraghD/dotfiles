# Dotfiles

Requires [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow)  

```wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daraghd/dotfiles/main/install.sh | bash```

If there is files already under ~/.config or ~/. etc they will need to be deleted or run stow with ---adopt, which will move them under ~/dotfiles
