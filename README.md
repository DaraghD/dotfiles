# Dotfiles

Requires [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow)  

```git clone https://github.com/daraghd/dotfiles ~/```  
```cd ~/dotfiles```  
```stow .```  
If there is files already under ~/.config or ~/. etc they will need to be deleted or run stow with ---adopt, which will move them under ~/dotfiles
